# Metodos-Numericos-UNMDP
Study material, codes, exams and everything you need so that you can take numerical methods at the National University of Mar del Plata
I am tired of hearing students fail this subject, and it is largely due to the lack of effort that teachers put into teaching.
That is why I decided to create this repository, to help all students in trouble.
